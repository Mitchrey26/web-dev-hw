1. Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.
  - A browser functions by the user sending a request through a network to a web server. The server responds with a collection of web content. The browser interprets the content received, and then displays the webpage. I mainly use google chrome, and will sometimes use safari. I have not done any web developing before.
2. What is a markup language? Describe one commonly used in development.
  - Markup languages are used for processing, defining, and the presentation of a text. Markup is another word for text, and there are many different languages such as HTML, XML, and XHTML. The most commonly used language is HTML. HTML is written in elements, and an element is one factor that makes up the web page <p>this is a paragraph element</p> Tags are another important part, and its is a code that is unique to the content from the document. The tag is what is written in-between the less-than(<) and greater than (>) sign.
