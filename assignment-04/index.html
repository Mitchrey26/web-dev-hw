    <h1>Oh Where</h1>

       Where did you go, my dear, my day;
       Where, oh where, did you go?
       To market, to maker of market, to say
       Too much of the little I know.

       Where did you go, my dear, my year;
       Why did you flee from me?
       I went from here to there to here
       Loitering breathlessly.

       Where did you go, my life, my own,
       Some thoughts too thick to think.</p>
