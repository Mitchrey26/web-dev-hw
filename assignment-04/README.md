1. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?
 - I Visited the New York Times Website. The snapshot is dated as March 24, 2003. The website is full of different stories, and different links to access these stories. The links back then are all blue text, and underlined. Now the links are simply bolded and when your mouse hovers over the text it fades a little bit. in 1993 the broader topics of news politics, international, sports, etc... was located on the side of the webpage. Now all of these topics are located on the top of the webpage. Back then only a few of the stories have descriptions  underneath the article title, and now almost all articles have some description or the start of the piece below the title and link.
