1. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?
 - I Visited the New York Times Website. The snapshot is dated as March 24, 2003. The website is full of different stories, and different links to access these stories. The links back then are all blue text, and underlined. Now the links are simply bolded and when your mouse hovers over the text it fades a little bit. in 1993 the broader topics of news politics, international, sports, etc... was located on the side of the webpage. Now all of these topics are located on the top of the webpage. Back then only a few of the stories have descriptions  underneath the article title, and now almost all articles have some description or the start of the piece below the title and link.
 2. Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?
 - Working with the GIT Module was was little confusing at first, but then after working on it for a a while I found it to be very helpful. I made a lot of little errors throughout my coding process and it would have taken much longer if I would have not been able to fix my mistakes when they first happened. Its also very helpful to be able to access your main file in finder, atom or Github online all from the module. I also found it helpful to continually check my live website and commit changes constantly while I was working so I would be able to quickly check if the codes I was adding or fixing where working.
