# Mitch Reynolds web-dev-hw
 My name is Mitch Reynolds, and I am a Parks Tourism and Recreation Managment student with a Media Arts Minor. I have always loved making short films and different multi media projects. I am looking forward to the class and learning about The web, internet and how I can Contribute to it all!
