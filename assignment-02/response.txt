1. Briefly describe one way how data travels on the internet.
One way data travels on the internet is through light. Light is really fast,
there is no signal loss over distance, but it is also very expensive, and hard
to work with. Light is shined through wires that are spanned over great
distances. In these cables are fiber optic cables and manufactured to reflect
light. The light bounces up down reflecting from side to side until it is
received on the other end. Multiple angles of light are shined through these
cables so more bits can be transferred.

2. What is the relationship between an IP address and the DNS?
The IP address is the name of a physical device such as a phone or a laptop.
The DNS will take a website and find the corresponding IP address to that
website, and that is what gives you access to the correct website.

3. What is a cookie?
Cookies are a way for the website to recognize a frequent user, and they keep
track of your preferences on the website.

4.List the the three basic parts of a URL.
The three main parts of a URL are the protocol, the domain name, and the path.
The Protocol is the HTTP:// and is states where the files live, most broad part
of the URL. The Domain name is like the state or city of your URL and gives you
direction to your site and all of its content. The path is like your house, and
a guided tour of each room it shows you how you ended up where you are on the
website, and usually ends with a file or page.
