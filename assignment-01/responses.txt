How is the Web different than the Internet?
The Web connects information, while the internet connects people. The Web is accessed via the internet, the internet is accessed
via people.

How does the internet Work?
The Internet often seems like this object that has no physical aspect to it, and for most people it is this tool that 
we can't phyiscally grasp. However, when you look at how the Internet really works you see that there are wires conencted 
throughout the earth connecting country to country, contienent to conteint. There is an Under sea cable Industry that span hundreds 
of thousand of miles to gives us our internet, and connection. These cables contain hair fibers, about the size of a peice of hair, 
When light shines through these fiber it starts to transmit our internet speed about 10 gigabits persecond. Each cable has around 8 
fibers, and these cables go through amplifers to multiply the signal. Our Computurs and phones are clients to the internet
connected ndirecty to it through an internet service provider(ISP), and when you are sending information to someone through the internet 
it goes through your ISP and to the wire until it reaches its final destanation. While traveling through these wires the item will
be brocken into smaller packages and won't be email won't be recieved or the tweet won't be posted until all these packages have reached
the final destantion. 

What is a Directory and its relationship to Files?
A Directory is another word for Folder. We make Folers, or directories, for each group of our files whether it be our script,
images, text, CSS, Index.Html, etc... We want to make sure that our diercotires are ordered in a clear and concise way where we
have our root directory(.) followed by sub folders. we have to maintain the relationship of hierachy throughout our direcories for 
example My-site/ will be the parent to content/ your content folder will hold items such as images/ or text/ and within those 
direcotries you will find your files such as logo.png or apples.txt
