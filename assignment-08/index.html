  <div id="steps" class="behind-text">
  <h1>Step 1: Background</h1>
  <p>The basic idea is simple. You have two pieces of wood connected by a hinge,
     with a bolt going through a T-nut in the bottom piece of wood, the bolt head
     pressing on the top piece, and a camera on the top piece. The hinge points at
     the North Star (or the Southern Celestial Pole), and as you turn the bolt,
     the camera swivels to follow the stars.<br><br>

    My design uses a 1/4"-20 carriage bolt. If the bolt is 292mm from the hinge,
    one turn per minute is what one needs to follow the stars. One can then have
    a rotation wheel attached to the knob with second markings printed on it,
    and then rotate it by hand in sync with a stopwatch. Being within 5-10 seconds
    of what the stopwatch is showing is generally good enough at lower magnifications,
    and this is quite easy to do by hand--one can either rotate continuously,
    or once every 5-10 seconds. A technical difficulty is "tangent error": as
    the bolt extends, the angle that the hinge swivels per rotation of the bolt
    decreases. One solution is to use a design with a circularly bent bolt
   (usually, a threaded rod).<br><br>

   But there is a simple way to get error compensation by using a carriage bolt
   with a rounded head in the tracker. The rounded head significantly reduces
   error. The attached graph shows the error in seconds of arc over time: the
   upper line is an uncorrected straight-bolt mount and the lower line is my
   mount with a rounded head carriage bolt. For 60-90 second exposures the
   error with the rounded head is very small. For maximal correction, after a
   few minutes of running you will rewind the tracker.<br><br>

   You can also attach a carefully cut or 3D-printed corrector to all but eliminate
   tangent error. There is an optional step at the end for this.</p>

  <div id="step 2" class="behind-text width">
    <h1>Step 2: Sand Bolt Head</h1>
    <p>Carriage bolt heads have embossed text on them. File it off and sand as
      smooth as you can. I did this by chucking it into a drill press and using
      a file and sandpaper.</p>
    </div>

<div id="step 3" class="behind-text">
  <h1>Step 3: Main Assembly</h1>
  <p>Cut two 3/4" thick boards into a long isosceles triangular shape as in the
    photos; the short end is where the hinges will go. The shape is not crucial.
    The only crucial dimension is that height of the triangle must be sufficient
    that the bolt hole 292mm from the hinges be some distance from the end to
    allow for room to mount a camera.<br><br>

    Attach the boards with hinges.<br><br>

    Draw a line at right angle to the hinges and drill a hole 292mm from the
    center of rotation of the hinge. I recommend that the hole be slightly
    smaller than the 1/4" bolt to reduce wobbling.<br><br>

    Hammer in the T-nut from the inside (i.e., when you close the hinges,
    the T-nut flanges will be between the boards), so that the bolt will go as
    shown in the last photo above.</p>

  <div id="step 4" class="behind-text">
    <h1>Step 4: Bolt Wobble Reducer</h1>
    <p>If you put the bolt in the T-nut, you will find that it wobbles, though the wood below the T-nut may damp the wobbling a little. What worked really well for me was to attach a piece of 1/4" Teflon that I got from another amateur astronomer friend, and drill a very tight hole for the bolt through it, and put it on the bottom of the board. A piece of wood or plastic with some lubricant might work, too.

      To make the hole fit nicely to the bolt, I rotated the bolt through the hole a number of times, with both a wrench (on the square section of the bolt) and chucking the bolt into a drill. Be careful not to damage bolt threads (on reflection, using a spare bolt is smart).

      Then I attached the wobble-reducer with two screws.</p>

  <div id="step 5" class="behind-text width">
      <h1>Step 5: Camera Mount</h1>
       <p>I bought a cheap camera ball mount somewhere online and mounted it on
         the top of the top board with a piece of dowel to raise the camera a
         little more to allow for even more freedom of movement.</p>

  <div id="step 6" class="behind-text wide">
      <h1>Step 6: Knob</h1>
        <p>Screw the carriage bolt through its T-nut. You will now want to
          attach a knob at the bottom. You will be manually turning this knob
          while photographing. When I make holes with a hole-saw, I tend to save
          the circles, so I initially attached a 2.4" circle to the end of the
          carriage bolt. That turned out to be too small for comfortably and
          smoothly turning, so I eventually switched to a 5" disc, which I
          attached with nuts and washers. The holes in it are for ease of turning
          and/or decorative. I also printed out numbers from 0 to 55, every 5,
          to put clockwise along the top edge of it for ease of timing.</p>
          </div>
  <div id="step 7" class="behind-text">
      <h1>Step 7: Optional: Mount for Camera Tripod</h1>
      <p>You will need a very heavy duty tripod as the whole assembly will need
         to be angled at an angle equal to your latitude, which will put eccentric
         forces on the tripod.<br><br>

        The board with the T-nut will be on the bottom. On the upper side of it
        countersink a hole (with a Forstner bit) for a T-nut whose threaded
        sleeve will come close enough to the bottom for the tripod bolt to hold
        it. I haven't actually tried this as I don't have a good tripod, and the
        exact location on the board that makes for good balance is something
        you'll want to figure out.<br><br>

        <b>If you did this, you can skip the next two steps.</b></p>

<div id="step 8" class="behind-text wide">
  <h1>Step 8: Wooden Tripod Mount</h1>
  <p>The barndoor mount will have to be mounted at an angle equal to your latitude.
     If you plan to travel, you will want to make it adjustable. And even if you
     don't want to travel, you'll want some adjustment for unlevel ground.<br><br>

     I made a very heavy duty tripod out of some 2x4s with a 3/4" board on top. It's
     short, roughly made, but super solid and heavy-duty. The photos pretty much
     explain it all: Cut the ends of the three 2x4s that go along the bottom at
     30 degrees. Then for the up-and-down 2x4s, do parallel angled cuts at the
     top and bottom at the same angle so they are flat on the ground and the board
     sits on the top. I attached them all with screws and white Gorilla Glue.</p>
     </div>
     <img src="./images/step-9.jpg" alt="Step 9 of our Camera mount project" width="500"
     height="300"/>
<div id="step 9" class="behind-text">
     <h1>Step 9: Wooden Tripod Head</h1>
     <p>I took a 4"x7"x3/4" board and drilled a 1/4" hole through the middle and
       then another 1/4" hole nearer the edge (about 1.4" away from the central
       hole). I then attached this board to the underside of the barndoor mount
       with two more hinges. These hinges are at right angles to the barndoor mount
       hinges, but you don't have to obsess about any of the measurements here
       as it will all be adjustable.<br><br>

       I put a carriage bolt sticking up through the middle of the platform on the top
       of the tripod. On top of that I put a 7 inch piece of 2x4 with a 1/4"
       hole drilled through the center. (If you want smoother rotation, put an
       old CD or DVD between the 2x4 and the top platform on the tripod.) And
       then on top of that I put the 4x7x3/4 board, and attached it all with a
       plastic wingnut for easily adjusting tension, and since when I was
       making the project, I had a lot of spare triwing nuts. You can just an
       ordinary nut if you like, or if you have a 3D printer, you can print one
       of my triwing nuts.<br><br>

       Continue the off-center hole in the 4x7x3/4 board through the 2x4. Then
       remove the top assembly, and make the hole in the 2x4 wide enough that a
       1/4" bolt nicely slides through it. Finally, put a T-nut in the hole in
       4x7x3/4 board, on the top side. And then put another carriage bolt through
       that T-nut. This carriage bolt will be used for adjusting the angle to
       match your latitude.</p>

<div id="step 10" class="behind-text">
      <h1>Step 10: Optional: Laser Mounts for Camera and Polar Alignment</h1>
      <p>Perhaps the easiest way to aim the camera for astrophotography is to
        put a green laser in a hotshoe mount. I made a 3D-printed mount. Make
        sure the laser is turned off or its beam will spoil the photo (see above!).
        Also, make sure you don't look into the laser and that you don't
        accidentally point it at another person or an airplane.<br><br>

        Note that my 3D-printed mount allows one to rotate the laser to depress
        the laser button permanently. <b>BE VERY CAREFUL WITH EYES AND AIRPLANES
        IF YOU DO THIS, AND MAKE SURE YOUR LOCAL LAWS ALLOW IT.</b><br><br>

        My 3D-printed mount also has a variant that lets you snap the laser on
        parallel to the hinges of the mount for easy pointing at Polaris
        (or the South Celestial Pole).<br><br>

        As another safety measure, I recommend putting an infrared block filter
        on the green laser, unless you know for sure that there is one. Green
        lasers emit a lot more light in infrared than in green, which is quite
        dangerous for eyes, and cheap pointers are missing the infrared block
        filter. You can buy a filter online and attach it with duct tape or with
        my little 3D-printable laser pointer filter holder.</p>

<div id="step 11" class="behind-text">
  <h1>Step 11: Photography!</h1>
  <p>Turn the knob to lower the bolt as much as possible. Mount the camera to the
  ball mount. Ideally, use a remote cable for the camera.<br><br>

    Sight Polaris along the barndoor mount hinges (or sight the south celestial
    pole if you're in the southern hemisphere). You can look along the hinges or
    you can put a laser right up against them. This will ensure that the camera
    will rotate along the correct axis.<br><br>

    Get a stopwatch or a stopwatch app. Not to destroy your night vision, ideally
    get one with a red display, like my open source Giant Stopwatch Android app
    (which you can switch to red mode, and which doesn't have ads that will
    destroy night vision), which also has a handy countdown before it starts.<br><br>

    Focus the camera manually on something distant (e.g., a bright star or planet).
    Prepare the camera for a timed exposure for 30 to 60 seconds, pointing at some
    interesting place in the sky. Set the knob on the barndoor mount to zero
    (e.g., aligning the zero with the side sticking out furthest from the mount--you
    don't need to be very precise).<br><br>

    Start the stopwatch (Giant Stopwatch has a delayed-start feature which makes
    this easier) simultaneously with the exposure, and then manually turn the knob,
    using the numbers on the knob to stay in sync with the stopwatch.
    Staying within five seconds is definitely good enough, and is actually not
    that hard.<br><br>

    Taking multiple 30-60 second exposures and stacking is the best way to
    proceed, but photo processing is beyond the scope of this Instructable.
    Here and here is some information on stacking.</p>
