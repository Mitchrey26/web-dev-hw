        <p>Rebirth takes place when everything falls apart. DIIV—Zachary Cole Smith
        [lead vocals, guitar], Andrew Bailey [guitar], Colin Caulfield [vocals,
        bass], and Ben Newman [drums]—craft the soundtrack to personal
        resurrection under the heavy weight of metallic catharsis upheld by
        robust guitars and vocal tension that almost snaps, but never quite…</p>
        <p>The same could be said of the journey these four musicians underwent to
        get to their third full-length album, Deceiver. Out of lies, fractured
        friendships, and broken promises, clarity would be found.</p>
        <img src="./images/diiv.jpg" title="A Photo of The Band" class="about-image"/>

        <p>“I’ve known everyone in the band for ten years plus separately and together
        as DIIV for at least the past five years,” says Cole. “On Deceiver,
        I’m talking about working for the relationships in my life, repairing
        them, and accepting responsibility for the places I’ve failed them. I
        had to re-approach the band. It wasn’t restarting from a clean slate,
        but it was a new beginning. It took time—as it did with everybody else
        in my life—but we all grew together and learned how to communicate and
        collaborate.”</p>

        A whirlwind brought DIIV there.

        <p>After a few years playing guitar with the psych-rock band Soft Black and
        playing drums for Beach Fossils, Zachary Cole Smith formed DIIV in 2011
        as a forum for his own songs. He enlisted childhood friend Andrew Bailey
        (like Smith, from Connecticut) on guitar, bassist Devin Ruben Perez (
        from New York City), and ex-Smith Westerns drummer Colby Hewitt
        (from California) as his live band. Smith, who originally named the
        project "Dive" after the Nirvana song of the same name, explained to
         Pitchfork that "everybody in the band is a water sign, that's kind
         of why the name Dive really spoke to us all." Smith would eventually
         change the spelling of the band's name after learning of the early-'90s
         Belgian industrial act by that name.</p>

      <p>Captured Tracks signed the band and released two singles, "Sometime" and
        "Human", which were recorded solely by Smith and had acted as demos.
        In May 2012, the band changed their name to DIIV, according to Smith,
        "out of respect for Dirk Ivens and the original Dive," a 1990s Belgian
        industrial group. "We’ve not been contacted by Dirk Ivens or his
        lawyers," Smith said in a press release, "but the short of it is that
        I don’t really give a fuck what the band is called." He continued,
        "I originated this project in a bedroom with no internet and didn’t know
        if it would ever leave the bedroom. 'DIVE', the word, was an element of
         what inspired the project in its genesis, but we’ve outgrown the name
         and its associations. The band is the same, the music is the same, the
         future will always be the same. A name is nothing."</p>

      <p>  On lists of the top 50 albums of 2012, Oshin was listed 22nd by Stereogum
        and 40th by Pitchfork.</p>


        <h3 class="is-the">2014–2017: Is the Is Are</h3>
        <iframe class="floating"style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=460779129/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=0f91ff/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://diiv.bandcamp.com/album/is-the-is-are">Is the Is Are by DIIV</a></iframe>
        <p>Is the Is Are was released on February 5, 2016. The album debuted at
        number 81 on the US Billboard 200. The release was followed by a
        February tour in Australia as part of St Jerome's Laneway Festival.
        However, just two days prior to the release, on February 3, Smith
        announced he was checking in for "long-haul" inpatient treatment.
        On March 26, 2016, the Liverpool venue Arts Club, which DIIV was
        scheduled to perform at on March 27, announced that the remainder of
         DIIV's European tour was canceled "due to an urgent health issue",
         which was later confirmed by DIIV's representatives.</p>

        <p>In an interview with NME in October 2019, bassist Colin Caulfield
          commented on this period in the band's career, "It definitely felt
          like an end point... I had tried really hard to be as supportive as
          possible for a long time. It was a hands up moment, it was the type of
          realization Cole had to come to himself. And he did, which is great."</p>

        <p>This period also saw the band take part in very occasional interviews
        with the media, with the band remaining relatively out of the public
        eye more than ever. Throughout 2016-2018 DIIV released a vast selection
        of cover songs, with the group performing songs by Elliott Smith, Cat Power,
        Sparklehorse and (Sandy) Alex G and My Bloody Valentine. </p>

        <h3 class="oshin">2018–present: Deceiver</h3>
        <iframe class="floated"style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 450px;"
         src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2562883581/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=0f91ff/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"
         seamless><a href="http://diiv.bandcamp.com/album/deceiver">Deceiver by DIIV</a></iframe>
        Produced primarily by the band themselves along with producer Sonny Diperri
        (My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails), the album was recorded in Los Angeles
        in March 2019.

        <p>On April 26, 2019, DIIV announced that their upcoming third album would
        be released this year via their Instagram account. On the same day,
        Pitchfork reported their announcement on the new album, and confirmed
        through a representative of DIIV, that Devin Ruben Perez had been
        dismissed from the band at the end of 2017.</p>

        <p>On July 24, 2019, DIIV released their first single in over three years,
        "Skin Game" and announced that their new album, Deceiver, will be
        released on October 4, 2019. On August 22, 2019, DIIV released their
        second single from Deceiver, titled, "Taker". On September 18, 2019,
        DIIV released their third single from Deceiver, entitled, "Blankenship".</p>

        <p>Upon release, Deceiver reached number 177 on the US Billboard 200 and
        received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from DIIV's earlier work.
       Many critics commented on its darker and heavier sound and lyrical
        themes. In his review for Q, Dave Everley praised the album, calling
        it "a success as both an artistic statement and a mea culpa." In a
        positive review, Jordan Bassett of NME wrote, "Where its predecessor was
         airy and spaced-out, Deceiver packs some seriously heavy riffs, sliding
         between monster rockers and moon-eyed grunge ballads that wouldn't sound
         too out of place on an early Smashing Pumpkins record."</p>
