1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
- A system font is something that the computer will initially have installed. For example a MAC system font would be Neue Helvetica. A web font is a font that is used on the world wide web. When HTML was first created font faces were controlled by the settings of each web browser. A web-safe font are fonts that are included with most OS. Web-safe fonts appear exactly as intended to most users.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
- For this weeks work I started by reviewing the course material on the website, then I went to the walk through video. and as the video went I worked on my piece section by section. once I got the layout of my website built I started to add the style factor of it starting with the color theme that I wanted to pursue, and than I went onto google to find different fonts that I felt matched the mood of the website.
