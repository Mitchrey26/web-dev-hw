    <p>
    Be ye, young or old,
    as a child of nine or ninety-nine<br>
    We all look to the magical time<br>
    when ol’ St. Nick comes a calling,<br>
    that jolly grey bearded man with a smile for all.</p>
<p>
    Traveling down the road  in his horse drawn sled<br>
    from  late dusk to early dawn.<br>
    The good ones know they’ll be visited by him,<br>
    adorned and wreathed with gifts from<br>
    head to toe.</p>
<p>
    They will sleep a peaceful slumber, full<br>
    of dreams of the bright morning to come<br>
    and the presents they so richly deserve<br>
    from a year of being so very very good.</p>
<p>
    I am afraid some may not be so inclined<br>
    at this joyous holiday time to partake of<br>
    all this festive cheer.</p>
<p>
    For you see, there are some children who lay deep in their<br>
    covers under the shadow of night as it plays<br>
    through their cold window pane,<br>
    waiting for him to come,<br>
    St. Nicks dark brother, the Other,<br>
    called Krampus to some.</p>
<p>
    This dark horned,  hairy tailed, cloven hooved creature<br>
    knows your heart of hearts<br>
    and all the naughty things you’ve done.</p>
<p>
    And he is not forgiving like<br>
    good ol’ St. Nick.</p>
<p>
    With bundled birch sticks in hand<br>
    he will greet you with a sharped tooth grin<br>
    right before he lays into your skin,<br>
    To beat you about the legs and arms,<br>
    a sweet painful present for all your<br>
    year’s sins and wicked charms.</p>
<p>
    Then if you have been especially bad<br>
    and you know who you are.</p>
<p>
    He will take down his big black<br>
    ruck sack from upon  his back<br>
    Open it up, grab you up<br>
    and stuff you in.</p>
<p>
    Then quick out the bedroom window<br>
    he flies to disappear down the dark road<br>
    with you never to be seen<br>
    by your family<br>
    ever again.</p>
