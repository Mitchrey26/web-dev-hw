## Assignment 10
1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
 - The Universal selector is used to style every element on a page. The star symbol is used to signify all. The element selector is used to select elements of a certain type. The class selector is slightly more specific than the element selector, and is used with a dot. The ID is the most specifi and is used with a number sign.
 2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.
 - My color palette consists of the colors green, red, and yellow. I chose these colors because the atari has lots of bright colors within the gaming system, and the 80's was also a time of a lot of color. The RGB values are rgb(242, 64, 64), rgb(40, 226, 9), rgb(55, 144, 181), and rgb(249, 179, 0).
 3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment
 - For this Assignment I had to spend a lot of time on the website taking notes, and a lot of time messing around on atom, knowing that what I was doing was probably not going to end up on the final project. I really struggled with understanding CSS, and it took me a long time to figure out what each universal, element, class, and id selector types do. I struggled with having to have everything in a specific order to. I hope the next project goes smoother for me as this one took me a long time to get done, and to even just get a very basic and broad understanding.
