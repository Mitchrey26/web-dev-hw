3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
 For this weeks work I first went through the course material, and I took notes and also messed around with spacings. Then I drew a simple web design of how I wanted to lay out my content. Tha I worked along with the course video working my code adding color and different spacings as I saw fit with my website. I found that leaving notes is extrememly helpful when organizing your website. The more I can break down my website into different sections the more organized I am, and it helps me to understand each function that I plug in.
